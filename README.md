# Yellowbox package tracking app

This is a simple web app that displays a list of orders (parcels) with some details like order status, ETAs, pickup locations, etc.

## How to use it 

When you start the app, the first page you are going to see is the Home section, which has a pitch of the package tracker. When you are in a different section of the app, by clicking on the navigation logo or "Home" it will bring you back to this section.

The next is the Track section which consists of the list of parcels. It shows the sender, and the status. The "Track" on the navigation bar links to this section, as well as the "Track now" button on Home section.

Each parcel is clickable, when you click on one, a popup window will appear with more information about the package, such as sender, estimated time of arrival, status,pickup location and a map of the location. The popup window can be closed by clicking on “X” on the top right corner or by clicking on the "go back" button.
